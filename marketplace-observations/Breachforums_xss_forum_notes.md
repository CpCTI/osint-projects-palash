## 🧠 Forum Behavior Patterns:

## 🔎 Analyst Insight:
- Actor tags like “trusted seller,” “verified,” etc. are self-issued — require cross-verification.
- Leaks often contain outdated data + fake listings for reputation building.

## ⚠️ Caution:
- Do not download raw dumps unless in isolated test environment
- Metadata and screenshots often contain valuable IOCs

## 🛠 Tools to Pivot:
- Screenshot OCR (e.g., TextSniper, Tesseract)
- VirusTotal Graph (for connected domains/IPs)
