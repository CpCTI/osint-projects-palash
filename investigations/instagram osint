OSINT Investigation Report

Case Title: Unmasking a Suspicious Instagram Persona

]


Objective:
To investigate a suspicious Instagram profile that exhibited inconsistent behavior, changed privacy settings mid-investigation, and appeared to be impersonating a female persona.

1. Initial Discovery

A follow request was received from an Instagram profile with a female display picture (DP).

No prior interaction existed between the investigator and the account.

Initial impression suggested the profile might be genuine, but further verification was deemed necessary.

2. Account Behavior

Initial Status: Public profile.

Subsequent Action: Profile switched to private shortly after initial viewing.

3. Image Analysis

Tools Used: Yandex, TinEye, and image unblurring tools.

Findings:

No strong matches found for the profile picture (possibly taken from Pinterest).

Image showed signs of being reused or sourced from a stock-style content library.

Background included small font and cap icons, but these were not uniquely identifiable.

4. Account Footprint Analysis

Have I Been Pwned: No results.

DeHashed: No leaks or associations.

NameCheck & WhatsMyName:

A gaming account ID was found on one platform.

Most platforms returned no results for the username.

5. Sherlock Enumeration

Tool Used: Sherlock (username enumeration tool)

Breakthrough: Found a Threads.net account with the same username.

Display picture here was of a male individual.

Profile included posts in mixed Hindi-English language.

One comment contained a mobile number, indicating intent to connect socially (e.g., asking for a girlfriend).

6. Phone Number Lookup

Tools Used: Synnefo, Spydialer

Findings:

Number was linked to a user based in Maharashtra, Mumbai.

No direct identity, but strong circumstantial tie to the Threads profile.

7. Persona Inconsistency

Observation:

The same username was used on both a female-looking Instagram account and a male-presenting Threads profile.

Sudden switch of the Instagram account from public to private further raised red flags.

Behavioral and visual artifacts suggest an attempt to impersonate or mislead.

8. Conclusion

Based on OSINT techniques and publicly available tools, we deduce that the Instagram profile in question was likely a persona account created by a male user under a female identity. The purpose appears to be social engineering, baiting, or social curiosity.

While the evidence doesn't confirm malicious intent, the behavioral pattern and inconsistent online footprint suggest deceptive motives.
