# 🧠 OSINT & Threat Intelligence Projects by Palash Chaturvedi

This repository is a collection of self-initiated cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and OSINT research work.  
Each folder contains categorized reports, observations, and analysis based on real-world leaked data, threat actors, and underground activity.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is an ongoing effort to showcase my hands-on learning and application in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and OSINT.

While the current content reflects real investigations and research, I’ll be continuously adding:
- Deeper actor profiling (with TTP mapping to MITRE ATT&CK)
- Threat landscape reports by region/sector
- IOC automation scripts (e.g., parser tools, Shodan scrapers)
- CTI lab walkthroughs, case studies, and writeups

I believe threat intelligence is about iteration — this repo will grow along with my skills and knowledge.
